This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Muhammad Saber (mtsaber@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Teghpreet Singh (tsingh8@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should drive roughly 50%
of the time the pair is working together, and at most 25% of an individual's effort
for an assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer must
be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work together, learning from eachother
not to divide the work into two pieces with each partner working on a different 
piece.
