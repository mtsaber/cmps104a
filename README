This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Muhammad Saber (mtsaber@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Teghpreet Singh (tsingh8@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair
should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working
together, and at most 25% of an individual's effort for 
an assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done
by a solitary programmer must be reviewed by the partner.
The object is to work together, learning from each other
not to divide the work into two pieces with each partner 
working on a different piece.

Teghpreet Singh spent 2 hours working alone.
Muhammad Saber spent  2 hours working alone.
